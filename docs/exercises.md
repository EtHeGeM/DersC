# Exercise Guidance

- Each module README lists micro-labs and graded exercises tagged by difficulty.
- Keep solutions small and focused on the concept being taught.
- Prefer tests-first when exploring tricky behaviors; Catch2 is available in every module.
- Use `clang-format` to keep submissions consistent.
- Benchmark only after passing correctness tests; premature optimization hides bugs.
