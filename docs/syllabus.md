# Syllabus

A 12-module, engineering-focused path to modern C++.

1. Intro + toolchain: compilers, build systems, debugging basics.
2. Types & operators: primitives, literals, operator semantics.
3. Control flow: conditionals, loops, scope.
4. Functions & modularization: signatures, headers, translation units.
5. Arrays & strings: contiguous storage, std::string, span.
6. Pointers & memory model: addresses, indirection, UB basics.
7. References, dynamic memory, RAII: ownership and lifetimes.
8. Structs & modeling: plain-old-data, invariants, value types.
9. OOP basics: classes, constructors, destructors, encapsulation.
10. OOP advanced: inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism.
11. STL: containers, iterators, algorithms, complexity.
12. Files, exceptions & mini project: Sensor Log Analyzer CLI.

Each module includes: conceptual notes, runnable reference code, exercises, and unit tests.
